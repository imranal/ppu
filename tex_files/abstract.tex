\section*{Abstract}      
Geodesics and hyperstreamlines are used to visualize second order tensors. 
We further look at a new way of visualizing second order tensor fields. By using 
the direction of geodesic curves in stead of eigenvectors, we make a different approach 
to so called integration methods. We extend the concept to include tensors which are not 
necessarily the metric.
